A maintenance release: an important **admin-password fix**, **GPS standby power savings**, and the
removal of **Adaptive Power Control** — plus two new boards, **muzi works R1 Neo** and an experimental
first cut at the **ThinkNode M9**.

## Highlights

### Fixed: uppercase letters in an admin password were silently lowercased

**If you set or changed an admin password on v1.16.5 and can no longer log in, this is why.** v1.16.5
introduced case-insensitive CLI keywords by lowercasing the first two words of every command before
matching them. That is safe for `get cad` — but `password <value>` puts the *value* in the second word,
so `password MyPass` was stored as `mypass`, and the password you typed afterwards never matched.
(`set guest.password <value>` has three words and was never affected.)

The normalizer has been removed and CLI commands are case-sensitive again, matching upstream Arduino
MeshCore. **If you are locked out, re-flash and reconfigure, or log in with the all-lowercase form of the
password you set.**

The one place autocapitalization genuinely hurts — typing commands to the V-Contact from a phone keyboard,
which capitalizes the first letter of every line — is handled narrowly instead: only character 0 of a
V-Contact chat line is folded. No command takes an argument at position 0, so no value can be touched.

### GPS standby now actually saves power

`CONFIG_PM_DEVICE` (device power management) is enabled for the first time, carefully scoped: system-managed
PM stays off, nothing suspends automatically, and every PM call is made explicitly from the main thread.
This buys two things:

- **The GNSS UART is suspended while GPS is off or in standby.** An armed nRF UARTE receiver keeps the
  high-frequency clock running — roughly **0.5–1 mA continuously on nRF52840** — even with the GPS module
  itself powered down. Nodes with GPS disabled in prefs were paying this for their entire uptime. The UART
  is resumed before every wake, so no NMEA is lost.
- **GNSS drivers that boot suspended now get resumed.** `gnss-nmea-generic` initializes suspended under
  device PM and never opens its data pipe until told to — this was the old "enabling PM breaks GPS" trap,
  now handled once at boot with retries.

**The UART suspend requires an nRF UARTE port and a board that can power the GPS module down.** Boards
without power control keep the UART running and forgo the saving: suspending the port while the module is
still streaming can wedge the main thread, leaving the radio deaf and the CLI answering `-> busy`. This
affects **RAK3401 1W** and **GAT562 30S**. Other UART drivers are left alone entirely — the saving is
UARTE-specific.

### Removed: Adaptive Power Control

APC tried to save battery by lowering TX power when neighbors reported more signal margin than they
needed. It has been removed entirely, because the saving it chased is not one most nodes actually pay.

TX power is only spent at the instant of a transmission. A companion that sits idle for days and sends a
handful of messages spends almost nothing on transmit to begin with — its drain is BLE advertising, the
radio sitting in receive, and the MCU. APC could not meaningfully reduce that. On the nodes where transmit
volume *is* high enough to matter, the feature never got a clean run: its measurement was structurally
confounded (the echo it measured comes from the neighbor's own fixed-power transmission and does not
respond to your reduction), and the staleness timer that ramped power back up could not tell "our link
degraded" from "the mesh was quiet." Rather than ship another round of tuning on a feature with no
demonstrated payoff and a real downside — a node that reduces too far goes silent, and cannot detect that
it has — it's gone.

What changes for you:

- **`set tx apc` and `set`/`get apc.margin` are removed.** `set tx <dbm>` sets a fixed power, as it always
  did, and `get tx` now answers with a plain number (`> 22`) exactly like upstream Arduino MeshCore.
- **Nodes that had APC enabled now transmit at their configured `tx` power.** If you had turned it on,
  check that your configured power is what you actually want — it is now used verbatim.
- **The APC line is gone from the on-device radio display**, and the TX row now shows a single power
  value instead of an `effective/max` pair — there is only one number now, so it is only printed once.
- **Your saved settings are safe.** APC's two prefs bytes are kept reserved at their original offsets, so
  no stored configuration shifts and nothing else is misread on upgrade.

## New boards

### muzi works R1 Neo

A pocket LoRa node — nRF52840 + SX1262 (RAK4630 stamp on a custom muzi baseboard), with GNSS, buzzer,
battery-backed RTC and a single user button. No display, so the UI is button actions only. It reuses the
RAK4631 flash layout (SoftDevice s140 v6.1.1, app @ `0x26000`), so the stock UF2 bootloader works as-is —
no bootloader reflash needed. The board's soft-power design is handled in devicetree: the DCDC rail latches
on at boot and is released on shutdown, so long-press power-off works properly.

Two things still want confirming against real hardware: the **battery divider multiplier** is a placeholder
(the two upstreams disagree — check `get batt` against a multimeter), and the **GNSS module identity** is
unconfirmed. Reports welcome.

Thanks to [@WillyJL](https://github.com/WillyJL), who requested this port and provided the hardware details / most of the code
it is based on.

### ThinkNode M9 — experimental, first testable release

**Consider this a preview, not a finished port.** It builds, flashes and runs, and it is worth testing if
you have the hardware and don't mind rough edges — but several things have not been confirmed on a real
device yet, and a few are knowingly missing.

It is ZephCore's first ESP32-S3 + LR1110 board, so a fair amount of it is new ground rather than a copy of
an existing port. Currently unverified: display init parameters (inherited from another ST7789V board — if
the screen is mirrored or upside down, that's a known one-line fix), GPS output from the CC1167Q module,
battery calibration, and whether the USB-C port reaches the native USB pads at all (BLE is the companion
path meanwhile).

The M9 has no user button in hardware — its keypad is the only input — so it now runs the full companion UI
driven by a new driver for the STC8H keypad MCU on I2C. Enter, back, home, menu and page prev/next are wired
up, and typed characters pass straight through. **The arrow keys are not mapped yet**: no reference we could
find documents their codes, so rather than guess, the driver logs any key it doesn't recognise along with its
hex value. Press the arrows once with a serial console attached and they can be bound in a one-line change.
Until then you can move between pages but not up and down within a list.

Also worth knowing on this board specifically: the **SD slot shares the radio's SPI bus** with the LR1110
and the display. An inserted card was confirmed to break LR1110 radio-firmware flashing on this board — the
write reports success and the radio then runs nothing. To keep a card from disturbing normal operation, the
firmware now puts any inserted card into SPI idle at startup, before the radio driver initialises, so it
stays quiet until something actually addresses it. **If the M9 misbehaves in a way you can't explain, try
it once with the card removed** — that is still the fastest way to rule the slot out.

Feedback from anyone with an M9 is genuinely useful here — the bring-up list in the board's README says
exactly what to look at.

## Other fixes and improvements

- **Fixed: Heltec V3 failed to build from source** once device PM was enabled. The upstream Zephyr board
  definition force-enables the GPIO power-domain driver without the devicetree guard that normally comes
  with it, and ZephCore's overlay deliberately replaces both of that board's power domains with plain
  regulators — so the driver was being compiled for hardware that no longer existed in the devicetree, and
  tripped over a helper that only exists under a config it never turned on. The power-domain subsystem is
  now explicitly off for V3, which is simply the truth about that board. Binary releases were unaffected;
  this only bit source builds. (V4 / V4.3 use ZephCore-local board definitions and were never affected.)
- **Air530z GPS driver patch** comments corrected to match the new PM strategy.

## Sidenote: LR1110 radio firmware updater

Not part of this release and not something you need — but if you have an LR1110 board and feel like it,
you can now update the **radio chip's own firmware** to Semtech's current version (`0x0402`, the H1_2026
security release). This is the LR1110's internal firmware, not ZephCore. Prebuilt tools for T1000-E and
ThinkNode M9 are in [`LR1110_updater/`](https://github.com/liquidraver/ZephCore/tree/master/LR1110_updater)
— flash one, watch it over serial, then flash ZephCore again afterwards.

Worth reading the [README](https://github.com/liquidraver/ZephCore/blob/master/LR1110_updater/README.md)
first. Two things in particular: the chip bootloader update it performs is **one-way**, and on the M9 you
must **take the SD card out** (it shares the radio's SPI bus and silently corrupts the write — the tool
checks and refuses to start, but still). Boards on older firmwares work perfectly well with
ZephCore and are fine left alone.

## Recommended upgrade checklist

1. **Set an admin password on v1.16.5?** Try the all-lowercase form if you are locked out; otherwise
   re-set it after upgrading.
2. **ESP32-S3 / ESP32-C boards that skipped v1.16.5:** flash `-merged.bin` once over USB/serial. Data survives.
3. **Everything else, from v1.16.2 onward:** just flash — bonds and data survive.
4. **From v1.16.1 or older:** just flash — self-migrates on first boot; re-bond once.
5. **From Official MeshCore:** just flash — auto-formats on first boot.
6. **Anything odd?** Format first.
