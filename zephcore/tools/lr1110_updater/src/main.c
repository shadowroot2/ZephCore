 * SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
 *
 * Standalone tool that updates the LR1110 radio firmware to v0x0402
 * (Semtech H1_2026 security release: CVE-2025-14857/14858/14859).
 * Flash this UF2 first, let it update the radio, then flash ZephCore main firmware.
 *
 * Firmware image source: https://github.com/Lora-net/radio_firmware_images
 * Bootloader protocol source: https://github.com/Lora-net/lr1110_driver

 *
 * Firmware 0x0402 only boots on chip bootloader 0x1001. Chips made before
 * the H1_2026 release run legacy bootloader 0x6500, so the update is
 * TWO-STAGE (matching Semtech's SWTL001 reference):
 *
 *   Stage A — bootloader update (only when the chip reports BL 0x6500):
 *     1. Force bootloader mode (reset with BUSY held LOW)
 *     2. Erase flash, WriteFlashEncrypted the lr1110_loader_6500 image
 *     3. Reboot — the chip now RUNS the loader firmware
 *     4. Loader command 0x8100: rewrite the on-chip bootloader
 *     5. Loader command 0x8101: verification report (6 checks)
 *     6. Loader command 0x8102: reboot; chip lands back in bootloader
 *     7. Verify GetVersion now reports BL 0x1001
 *
 *   Stage B — transceiver firmware:
 *     8. Erase flash, WriteFlashEncrypted the 0x0402 image (61320 words)
 *     9. Reboot into firmware, verify version == 0x0402
 *    10. Reboot MCU into UF2 DFU mode (nRF52) / idle for reflash (ESP32)
